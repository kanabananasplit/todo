JS1 - Todo List
Overview:
“To-Do List” is a simple JavaScript app that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. The user should also be able to edit, delete or mark tasks as complete. The development of this app will take place in two phases, Phase I & Phase II.  Phase III is optional.


Requirements:
The app must be written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
The app will be client-side only and will not connect to any mid-tier or server
The app does not need to be cross browser compatible
The app does not need to be responsive
When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the add button, it will get added to the list
If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list
If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
If the user refreshes the page, the task list will be cleared


Phase I - Without JQuery:
You CANNOT use JQuery in phase 1
Your code will be reviewed at the completion of phase 1

Phase II - With JQuery:
Create a separate directory in your projects folder for this version of the assignment
Implement the changes suggested during the phase 1 code review
Modify the javascript to take advantage of JQuery
Your code will be reviewed at the completion of phase 2

Phase III - Optional Features
Animate the strike-through when you check off a task as “done”
Add a priority (high, med, low) to the tasks
Clear out the "To-do" field after you add the task and put the cursor back in the box
Add a "Clear Completed Tasks" button that deletes all checked tasks
